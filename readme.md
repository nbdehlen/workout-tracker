## Idea

Throughout the years I have typically saved my workout logs in excel files or text files on a desktop.
For me this came with some drawbacks:
No ability to log workouts on the go and resorting to taking temporary notes during workouts
in order to later input them into my desktop workout log.

## Goal

To be able to log a wide variety of workouts with a high level of detail on both android and desktop (Rest-API currently).

## Purpose

I started looking into the available workout apps on android. There were certainly a lot of them
but I couldn't find one with the level of customization I wanted and with the option to log workouts on a desktop or access to the API.

## Target group

This app is for anyone who require a high level of detail in their workout log and the ability to log workouts from both their mobile and desktop.
